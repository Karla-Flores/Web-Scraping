<h3>Goal</h3>
<p>The purpose of this challenge was to create BeautifulSoup, Splinter, and Pandas to scrape five different web pages related to Mars and display the results on a webpage using MongoDB and Flask to demonstrate an effective web app to house data regarding Mars' weather, hemispheres, latest news, and facts. It is also meant to update as time goes on, meaning when new articles hit the Mars NASA page, the web app will update on its own, bringing further information to the app users.</p>
